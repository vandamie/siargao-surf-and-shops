# siargao-surf-and-shops
     The purpose of Siargao Surf and Shops is to promote the place, surf shops, 
     and business industry in the island of Siargao, Surigao del Norte, Philippines. 
     To build a massive impact on the community by providing sponsorship for young generations 
     like scholarships, surfboards, and feeding programs for all malnourished children. 
     We want to create a cooperative center that can help the government to manage solid waste on the island.
